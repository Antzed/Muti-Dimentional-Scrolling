# Muti-Dimentional-Scrolling

---

The problem:

The problem that this repo want to address is the lack of non-linear navigation of the current method of 'scrolling'.

> Note: By scrolling, I mean current ways of viewing digital interface, such as web pages, or web tabs. They are all linear, always from entity a --> entity b --> entity c

Examples:

Both picture shown above are examples of linear scrolling. You go from one view to the next sequentially. Of course, people have been attempted to solve this problem by doing the muti-panel view, like this,

But the problem with this solution is that since each individual panel is designed with linear/sequential scrolling in mind, the user will eventually lay their eyes on one and only one panel, and still browse these panels in a sequential order.

Some note taking app, like Obsidian, attempted to use a network type navigation method, which utilizes wiki links.

Their method have some resemblance of multidimensional navigation, but unfortunately the web view shown in the picture above is only for visualization, its interactive abilities is extremely limited.

## So..

Perhaps, even if there is a true multidimensional navigation method, it will be limited by human's habit of viewing things sequentially. Hence, I believe instead of finding the "true way", we invent a method is the infinitely close to the true mutidimensionality. We make sequential navigation so effortless, while creating links between all 'web pages', so that a illusion of multidimensional navigation will be constructed. And since we only need to achieve a sense of mutidimensionality for humans to utilized it as a tool for creative thinking, we've achieved our goal

## possible solutions

one such solution I can think of, is to scroll in a 3D space. This idea is inspired by the game 5d chess and it look sort of like this

or like this

Imagine each chess board/cube is a web page, and at any given time the user is on one dimension(x,y,z).

When the user scroll the mouse wheel, the webpage switch between them along one dimension, like so

and when is a certain input is inputted, such as a key, the dimension change.
